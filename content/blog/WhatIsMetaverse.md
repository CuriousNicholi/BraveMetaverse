Satellite a9.126 dawns comfortably under the blanket of a warm horizon.\
It’ll be dark soon. That’s when she remembers.

Grandma got one of the very first implants, which is probably the only reason she’s still with us today -- and one of the few we have left. See, right around this time every year, when the sun sets between those trees and the skies clear away from the cloud… that blinky yellow light right there lines up perfectly with the horizon. The signal must bounce off the atmosphere or something but for like twenty minutes, Grandma’s reception comes in loud and clear. It streams recordings of her distant memories.. Stories about what it was like back then, before Beginning. Sounds like she's already there.

“Metaverse? I remember my first time in the Metaverse…”

## What is the Metaverse?

Buzzword schmuzzword. You won’t be hearing this word on the news anytime soon, but you might have already heard it around the house. Metaverse. It means “beyond universe”, and is going to be all the rage in three years or so.
For many of you, this is the first time you’ve seen that word. For others, it’s a video game you heard about somewhere. Or the future of entertainment. Perhaps even a successor to the World Wide Web?\
You are correct. It’s all of those things. It’s also what your kids are playing around in every time they put on that VR headset.

Okay... so what is this Metaverse?\
Simply put, the Metaverse is where virtual reality lives. It’s an abstract new world reaching beyond our physical universe. More specifically it’s the shared space where virtual and reality converge, and home to all the extended realities. From video games and robots to education and industry, the Metaverse is already developing into its own diverse community, culture, and economy.

If you bought VR headsets for that big holiday your family celebrates every year, your kids have probably visited at least one Metaverse. And that’s okay because you and I interact with the Metaverse every day too. Our cellphones, smartwatch, Alexa, those big expensive tractors you see farming giant cornfields out in the country. They’re all connected to each other, humming along in harmony, communicating through a network of data and algorithms designed to make our lives better.

In other words: the Holodeck... but not quite yet.

Right now the Metaverse is a think tank of young entrepreneurs and creative coders. Kids don’t just play games in the Metaverse, they design and build their own. Working together, they learn to code with blocks you can hold and connect like LEGO, not just numbers typed onto a screen. An inspiring environment for visual learning and creative thinking. It's also a big world with lots of stuff to learn and even more to think about. No doubt you're thinking about it right now. Plenty to process until the next blog post.

Passionate to say the least, I’ve spent the past three years immersed in the developing virtual reality culture, actively involved in VR community and educational opportunities. I bring all the yummy nuggets and hidden gems back to the real world for you to peruse at your leisure. Together we’ll explore and discuss educational programs, career paths and opportunities, intercultural communication, and children’s safety in social VR. Because we all know kids learn tech way faster than the rest of us.
