We open in the passenger seat of a high-intensity car chase. Your heart is racing.

INT. SPEEDING VEHICLE - DAY
GOOD GUY is in hot pursuit, mere inches from BAD GUY’s bumper, aggressively threading the streets of Velo City.
Sqealing tires drift tight corners knocking down trash cans. Scattering crowded streets and innocent shoppers.
At the straight away, Good Guy almost takes the edge when Bad Guy cuts a hard right into the busy intersection, barely missing a school bus full of innocent children, slipping away into the dark alleys just outside of Good Guy’s jurisdiction. Good Guy screeches to a stop.

            GOOD GUY
        (frustrated)
    Dammit!

Good Guy jumps out of the car and slams his fist on the roof, scowling in defeat. There’s nothing he can do now.

EXT. SEEMINGLY ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - SUNSET

            GOOD GUY (V.O.)
                (sternly)
    Because I'm done putting their lives at risk!

INT. GOOD GUY SECRET HEADQUARTERS - SUNSET

A tired but determined team of experts for hire contemplate this mission's unlikely success.

            GOOD GUY
        (settling, confident)
    We're just going to have to find another way.

The team quiets. Good Guy devises a new plan, presenting an extremely detailed roadmap of their new mission.


Calculated planning turns into information overload. Three minutes of dialogue feels like a whole hour. The story is dragging.
You begin to yawn. Your heart rate has dropped from an excited 92bpm to a restful 68. There’s just too much talking. Unconsciously, you reach for your cell phone to scroll the latest social media news. The film has lost your attention.
